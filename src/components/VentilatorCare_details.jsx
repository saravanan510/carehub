                  Ventilator Care
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Ventilators at home were an anomaly until a few years ago. It
                  was thought of as risky and people believed that it was not a
                  medically safe decision to provide nursing care to a patient
                  on a ventilator at home. However, times have changed. Numerous
                  medical and healthcare services are now available in the
                  comfort of one’s home and nursing care for mechanical
                  ventilation is one of them. It is completely safe to keep a
                  patient on a ventilator at home if you are under the guidance
                  of the carehub healthcare service providers. With a little
                  training and practice, or assistance from professional nurses
                  and healthcare staff, it is possible for home care for
                  ventilator patients to be surrounded by family and loved ones
                  while receiving nursing care for mechanical ventilation
                </p>

                  What Are the Benefits Of Nursing Ventilator Care?
                </h4>
                <p>
                  The benefits of a patient receiving nursing ventilator care at
                  home are numerous. Nursing care of a patient on a ventilator
                  at home ensures that the patient feels more safe, comfortable
                  and at ease compared to a hospital or healthcare facility.
                  Receiving nursing ventilator care at home ensures that the
                  patient is surrounded by loved ones and family, instead of in
                  a stressful and tense environment of a hospital among other
                  patients. At home, the patient experiences peace of mind and
                  there’s a high chance that the patient might recover faster at
                  home. Nursing ventilator care at home also reduces the risk of
                  the patient acquiring infections from the hospital. Home
                  ventilator care is much safer since the chances of catching an
                  infection from caregivers or family members are comparatively
                  low
                </p>
                <p>
                  The benefits can be further categorized into medical and
                  personal benefits.
