            <p>
              Parkinson's disease is diagnosed, and this results in a mixture of
              shock, anxiety, and confusion. Nobody is fully sure what causes
              neurodegenerative brain disorders, which have an impact on how
              well muscles move and are controlled.

            <p>
              Carehub Services is aware of the challenges that you and your
              family carers may have in managing your Parkinson's illness. Since
              handling the unpredictable and frequent symptoms of Parkinson's
              disease can be painful and stressful, we have competent and kind
              in-home carers that can help.
