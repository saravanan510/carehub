                Having access to a doctor at the comfort of your home was a
                privilege few could enjoy until now. Carehub Doctor Home Visit
                service eliminates the disruptions to normal life due to
                frequent trips for tests and reviews. With our Doctor Home
                visits, you can now have doctors and physicians conduct a
                detailed assessment and provide expert guidance in treating
                individual needs at your residence.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the patient’s condition, our doctors create a detail
                care plan for recovery. Senior citizens who may be immobile,
                patients recovering from chronic diseases or major surgeries
                especially benefit from our Doctor consultations at home. Some
                of the services provided during our visits are:
